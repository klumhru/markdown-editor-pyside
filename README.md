Markdown editor in PySide
==============

This is the first in a series of practice projects writing simple applications for ubuntu/other plaforms.

The design objectives are simple:
1. Minimalist UI with no menus or status bars
2. Simple intuitive, standard keyboard commands to perform all actions
3. On the fly conversion of plain text to markdown and display in a separate rich text area

## PySide
@StefanKjartansson pointed me to using PySide for the project.

On first glance PySide seemed simple to use and made for straight forward code.

I created the .ui files QT designer, but I think I'll see about using QML instead as it is less verbose and easier to edit after the fact. It also does not require the use of xml at any point.
